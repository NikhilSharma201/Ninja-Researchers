# Ninja-Researchers
#📌 Overview
Researchers spend 40–60% of their time reading and cross‑referencing papers. Existing tools summarize but fail to reason across sources, leaving contradictions unresolved and research gaps unnoticed.

Ninja Researchers is an autonomous agent framework that:

Retrieves academic papers from trusted sources (arXiv, Semantic Scholar, PubMed).

Summarizes key claims.

Detects contradictions and highlights unexplored gaps.

Generates a structured research report with citations.

(Bonus) Includes a Devil’s Advocate sub‑agent to challenge claims for robustness.

#🚀 Features
Autonomous Retrieval: Smart query refinement and database search.

Summarization Layer: Condenses abstracts into concise claims.

Reasoning Layer: Detects contradictions, assigns confidence scores, identifies gaps.

Report Generation: Produces structured Markdown/PDF reports.

Explainability: Agents can explain papers and highlight research scope.
